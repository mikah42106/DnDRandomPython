# DnDRandomPython
Many hours have gone into this project I am new to python and this was meant as a first time project for me to learn python along with doing, so if any code is wrong, or can be minimized and you would like to help, just tell me or put in in a pull request, I will look over it and may accept it and if I do I will add you to the credits.

Creates a random DnD 5E character or you can provide parameters to make a character with it, basically a full character generator in python. Support coming in the future for other versions of DnD and for more things and more updates later, stay tuned!
